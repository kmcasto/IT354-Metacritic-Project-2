IT 354 Project - Metacritic Picker
==================================

Completed for the Group Project Assignment of IT 354, by Alex Shaw and Kevin Castor.

This particular web application (Developed using MEAN) allows users to find video games they might enjoy by browsing whichever titles are available for any systems they have, and then selecting them based on the accumulative score given to each game by critics.

## Setup ##

The following development tools are required in order to build and execute this project from it's source code form:
* Node.js
* NPM

In addition, an active internet connection is required.

As long as those requirements are meet, any other dependencies will be automatically downloaded from the internet.

## Building ##

After cloning the repository from GitHub, and opening a Terminal/Command Prompt in the project directory, execute the following commands to build and test-run our project:

```shell
$ npm install
$ gulp
$ gulp run
```

If everything went okay, the server should now be running. The server will print out which URL to open, so open it in your web-browser to try it for yourself! 

Happy Gaming!!!
